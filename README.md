For an accurate reproduction of my own performances of this patch you will need two VSTs:

iZotope Vinyl: https://www.izotope.com/en/products/create-and-design/vinyl.html

Spitfire Audio LABS: https://www.spitfireaudio.com/labs/
  Specifically the DRUMS, SYNTH, and SOFT PIANO
  
  

This patch is undergoing evolutions regularly to continue development into something special.
